7) Write a Program to Display Prime Numbers Between Two
   Intervals (entered by the user) Using Functions
   
8) Write a Program to check if an integer (entered by the user)
   can be expressed as the sum of two prime numbers,if yes then
   print all possible combinations with the use of functions.
   Example
   Enter a positive integer: 34
   OUTPUT:
   34 = 3 + 31
   34 = 5 + 29
   34 = 11 + 23
   34 = 17 + 17
   
9) Write a Program to Convert Binary Number to Decimal
   manually by creating user-defined functions.
  

10) Write a Program to Convert Decimal to Binary number
    manually by creating user-defined functions.
	
11) Write a Program to Calculate Factorial of a Number Using
    Recursion
12) Write a Program to Find G.C.D of two numbers entered by
    user Using Recursion
	
13) Write a Program that takes n element from user and displays
    the largest element of an array
14) Write a Program that calculates the standard deviation of 10
    data using arrays
	
15) Write a Program that takes the array of five element and the
    elements of that array are accessed using pointer.

16) Write a Program that adds two matrices using Multidimensional Arrays where the number of rows r and columns c is
    entered by user (Value of r and c < 100)

17) Write a Program takes two matrices of order r1*c1 and r2*c2
    respectively. Then, the program multiplies these two matrices (if
    possible) and displays it on the screen.
	
18) Write a Program that takes a matrix of order r*c from the user
    and computes the transpose of the matrix.

19)  Write a Program that takes three integers from the user and
     swaps them in cyclic order using pointers.
     Example:
     Enter value of a, b and c respectively:1 2 3
     Value after swapping numbers in cycle:
     a=3
     b=1
     c=2
20)  Write a Program to Find the Frequency of given Character by
     user in a String
	 
21)  Write a Program to Remove all Characters in a String Except
     Alphabets.
     Example:
     Enter a string: p2'r"o@gram84iz./
     Output String: programiz
	 
21)  Write a Program to Concatenate (join) Two Strings entered
     by user
	 
22)  Write a C++ program to change every letter in a given string
     with the letter following it in the alphabet (ie. a becomes b, p
     becomes q, z becomes a).
     Example:
     Sample Input: Abcdef3
     Sample Output: Bcdefg3
	 
23)  Write a C++ program to count all the words in a given
     string.Words must be separated by only one space
     Example:
     Sample Input: Siddharth Singh
     Sample Output: number of words -> 2
	 
24)  Write a C++ program to capitalize the first letter of each
     word of a given string. Words must be separated by only one
     space
     Example:
     Sample Input: cpp string exercises
     Sample Output: Cpp String Exercises
	 
25)  Write a C++ program to find the largest word in a given
     String.
     Example:
     Sample Input: C++ is a general-purpose programming language.
     Sample Output: programming
